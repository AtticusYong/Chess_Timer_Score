# Chess Timer & Score
In this repository, I made my personal chess timer and score counter. The timer follows the same principles as in this [repo](https://github.com/brandon-wallace/chess_clock2/blob/main/js/script.js). It is very useful to me and all of the code is cleverly made, although there are some bugs.

For the score counter, I used an increment and decrement score counter that is entirely made using HTML, CSS & JS. It increments by 0.5, so that if there id a draw in a chess game, it is even. Feel free to use the code.
